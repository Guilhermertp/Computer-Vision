Project: **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using CNN with Distributed Training and TensorFlow Serving Deployment**

Overview:
This project focuses on building an advanced **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to detect **diabetic retinopathy**, a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes, from retinal images. Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide, and early detection through automated systems can significantly enhance treatment outcomes. The project involves training a CNN model with **distributed training** to speed up the process, and deploying the trained model using **TensorFlow Serving** for scalable, real-time predictions.

 Key Components:

1. CNN Model for Image Classification**:
   - A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is designed to analyze retinal images and classify them into different stages of diabetic retinopathy (e.g., no DR, mild, moderate, severe, or proliferative DR).
   - The model architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for downsampling, and fully connected layers for final classification.
   - The training dataset consists of **retinal fundus images**, typically sourced from public datasets like **Kaggleâ€™s Diabetic Retinopathy Detection dataset**.

2. Distributed Training**:
   - **Distributed training** is employed to train the CNN model faster and more efficiently by leveraging multiple GPUs or machines. This helps to significantly reduce the training time for large datasets.
   - The implementation uses TensorFlow's **`tf.distribute`** module, which supports various distribution strategies like **MirroredStrategy** for synchronous multi-GPU training.

3. TensorFlow Serving Deployment**:
   - After training the CNN model, it is deployed using **TensorFlow Serving**, a flexible, high-performance model serving system designed for machine learning models.
   - TensorFlow Serving enables real-time predictions via a REST or gRPC API, making the model accessible for use in web applications, mobile apps, or clinical tools.
   - The model is containerized for deployment using **Docker**, ensuring scalability and ease of deployment across different platforms.

4. Model Evaluation and Monitoring**:
   - The model's performance is evaluated using common classification metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **AUC (Area Under Curve)**, and **confusion matrix**.
   - During deployment, **monitoring** tools (such as TensorBoard or Prometheus) are set up to track the model's performance in production and ensure it continues to deliver accurate predictions.

Objectives:
- **Automated detection** of diabetic retinopathy from retinal images using a deep learning model.
- **Accelerated training** using distributed training techniques to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Seamless deployment** of the trained model using TensorFlow Serving, ensuring it can be used in real-time applications.
- **Scalability** and performance monitoring to ensure the model maintains accuracy and handles a large number of predictions.

Tech Stack:
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building the CNN model and handling distributed training.
- **TensorFlow Serving** for model deployment.
- **Docker** for containerization.
- **Python** for scripting and development.
- **NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib** for data manipulation and visualization.
- **OpenCV/Pillow** for image preprocessing.
